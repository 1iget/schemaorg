<!-- Updated 2016-08-18

These proposed by CG chair @philbarker as stabilizing soon:
* Course + properties: courseCode, coursePrerequisites, hasCourseInstance
* CourseInstance + properties: courseMode, instructor

Definitions here copied in from https://github.com/philbarker/schemaorg-1/tree/feature/ext-course/data/ext/course
Also note that the related issue https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1209 is merged into core.

While these are in pending each term has a few lines of boilerplate used by pending.schema.org / pending.webschemas.org.

These are now (experimentally) in boilerplate-195.rdfa instead.
